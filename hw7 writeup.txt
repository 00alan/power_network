exact numerical answers for each part is shown in cvx output of each .m file (one file for each part of the project)



1) 
(optimal output for the seven nonzero generator buses in Pg, in order. The rest are zero for Pg)
Pg7 = 
   16.6067
  -10.4444
    0.6211
    3.7256
   -3.2352
   -3.3278
   -1.2591

cvx_optval =
  -32.4730



2) 
Bus 4 has the lowest prices (around 1.80) and bus 9 has the highest 
prices (around 5.75). Bus 4 is a local bus, and the capacity of the line 
connecting it to bus 6 (which is a generator bus) was set to 
zero. Bus 9 is a generator bus, and the capacity of the line 
connecting it to bus 8 (which is a generator bus) was 
set to zero. Here we identify the lowest priced bus as a 
local bus connected to a generator bus by a line with 
capacity zero, and we identify the highest priced bus as a 
generator bus connected to another generator bus by a line
with capacity zero. Thus my intuition is amount of loads and 
the availability of other generators connected to these 
buses leads to the maximal and minimal prices at these
aformentioned buses 4 and 9. 
 

Referencing the cvx output for the hourly pricing of
buses 4, 9, and 33 (arbitrarily selected) we see that the
price for an individual bus is relatively stable throughout 
the 24 hours, with bus 4 having prices near 1.80, bus 9 
having prices near 5.75, and bus 33 having prices near 4.25.
However the prices do follow a slight hourly pattern with the 
buses' higher end prices occuring between hours 18-22. 




3) 
As shown by running the .m file for part 3, the LP successfully detects all attacks for z values of 1,2,3
